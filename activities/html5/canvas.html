I think its not fair to talk about Orange and not say that the new dude is gonna commit suicide and they're trying to prevent that. I mean sure you said many times that this was going to be a tear-jerker, but I mean suicide is pretty heavy and an all together different from regretting not doing HS stuff. (also I don't think its a spoiler because that's the whole plot of this thing, they tell you that at like episode 2)
